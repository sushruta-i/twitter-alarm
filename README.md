# twitter-alarm
Plays an mp3 file (typically alarm sound) if a twitter account sends a new tweet. It checks the account every second.

You will need a twitter developer account (https://developer.twitter.com/en). 
NOTE: Once you sign up, you will also need to create a file containing the keys from your account. The keys.py file should be formatted as follows:

consumer_key = 'CONSUMER_KEY'  
consumer_secret = 'CONSUMER_SECRET'  
access_token = 'ACCESS_TOKEN'  
access_token_secret = 'ACCESS_SECRET'  

Replace each string with the appropriate key. More detailed instrucitons can be found by searching 'tweepy authentication'.
