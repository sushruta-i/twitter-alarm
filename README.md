# twitter-alarm
Plays an mp3 file (typically alarm sound) if a twitter account sends a new tweet. It checks the account every second.

You will need a twitter developer account (https://developer.twitter.com/en). NOTE: Once you sign up, you will need a file containing the keys from your account. I have called mine keys.py.

Alarm sounds can be found online.
