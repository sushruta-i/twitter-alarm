# twitter-alarm
Plays an mp3 file (typically alarm sound) if a twitter account sends a new tweet. It checks the account every second.
You will need a twitter developer account. NOTE: You also need a keys.py file containing keys from your twitter developer account
The alarm sound file should be placed in the home directory.
